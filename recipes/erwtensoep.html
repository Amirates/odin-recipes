<h3>The best soup from the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Essentially a meal in itself, erwtensoep is a thick pea soup, so thick in fact that some say you should be able to leave a spoon standing up in it!</p>
<p>The Dutch traditionally eat Erwtensoep on New Year`s Day</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<uL>
    <li>7 1/2 cups (1 3/4 liters) water</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (300 grams) dried green split peas</li>
    <li>3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) pork belly, Dutch speklapjes or thick-cut bacon</li>
    <li>1 pork chop</li>
    <li>1 bouillon cube, vegetable, pork, or chicken</li>
    <li>2 stalks celery</li>
    <li>2 to 3 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
    <li>1 large potato, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 small leek, sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup cubed celeriac</li>
    <li>1 pound sausage, chopped rookworst smoked sausage, or smoked soft metwurst or frankfurter/wiener sausages</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 handful celery leaves, chopped, for garnish</li>
</uL>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>In a large soup pot, bring water, split peas, pork belly or bacon, pork chop, and bouillon cube to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, and skimming off any foam that rises to the top. </li>
    <li>Remove the pork chop, debone, and thinly slice the meat. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add the celery, carrots, potato, onion, leek, and celeriac to the soup. Return to the boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, uncovered, for another 30 minutes, adding a little extra water if the ingredients start to stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Add the smoked sausage for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. When the vegetables are tender, remove the bacon and smoked sausage, slice thinly, and set aside.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a smooth consistency, pur√©e the soup with a stick blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the meat back to the soup, setting some slices of rookworst aside.</li>
    <li>Serve in heated bowls or soup plates, garnished with slices of rookworst and chopped celery leaf.</li>
