    <h3>Dutch Pancakes</h3>
    <p>Pannenkoeken have remained a staple of local cuisine in the Netherlands for centuries, and it`s not hard to see why.</p>
    <p>These hearty Dutch pancakes can be topped with sweet or savory ingredients; such as bacon, salmon, apple, cheese, chocolate, powdered sugar, and stroop (a treacly Dutch syrup).</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <uL>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 c milk</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 pork chop</li>
        <li>2 c unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Butter, for cooking</li>
    </uL>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the egg until slightly foamy. Add the milk and salt, whisking to combine. Add the flour, slowly, whisking as you add, until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a 10 inch skillet over medium heat. Add a little butter to coat the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup of batter to the pan and swirl it around to coat the pan. (If using add-ins, sprinkle them over top of the wet batter.) Cook the pannekoek over medium heat until it is just getting dry on the top and releases from the pan, 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pannenkoek and cook for 1-2 minute on the second side, until lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Remove the pannenkoek from the plan and place on a platter. Keep your stack of pannekoeken warm in a warm oven while you coat the skillet again with butter and cook up the rest of the batter.</li>
    </ol>
