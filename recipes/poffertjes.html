    <h3>Dutch Poffertjes</h3>
    <p>If you can`t quite manage a pannenkoeken, then why not have the next best thing poffertjes. Made with yeast and buckwheat flour, these small, fluffy pancakes have a light and spongy texture and are a popular food at Dutch festivals and events.</p>
    <p>Food stalls usually serve them warm on a piece of cardboard paper with powdered sugar, butter, or syrup (stroop). They are cooked in special poffertjes pans, which have lots of shallow indentations in them.</p>
